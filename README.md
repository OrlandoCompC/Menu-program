# Menu-program
A program where the user chooses an option from the menu

This program has a menu and the user can choose one of the following options 

    Draw Shape
    a) Triangle
    b) Rectangle
    2 - Fermat's Last Theorem
    3 - Facto-Power Series
    4 - Check Password
    5 - Quit''
    
    It uses functions and an imported module called functions_tools.
    I used any function for the password checker because it was the most productive method I was permitted to use at the time.
    Additionally, it was the first application that I made an effort to make as user-proof as possible.
